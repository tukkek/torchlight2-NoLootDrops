# No Loot Drops for Torchlight II

This Torchlight 2 mod makes enemies drop only gold, allowing you to focus on clearing while adventuring - leaving the item management and theorycrafting for when you're safely back in town. And why would a dog ever drop a sword or ring...?

This does not affect **anything** other than drops from monsters - so chests (and all other item containers), mimics, golden crabs, etc. are not affected. Normal, champion, boss and other common monsters are affected.

With random loot still being generated by chests and other sources, this approach allows for the usual excitement of coming across epic gear (and the challenge of making the most out of that), while also promoting more intentional agency and strategy in your theorycrafting because you have to deliberately choose when and how to spend your gold rather than just picking incremental upgrades off of the ground.

## How to install

**Steam workshop version:** if you own the game on Steam, simply open the [Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2482564330) and hit the "subscribe" button. Next time you launch the game, enable the mod as normal through the official Mod Launcher.

**Manual install:** Download the latest version of the mod file from [the GitHub release page](https://github.com/tukkek/torchlight2-NoLootDrops/releases) and place it on your Torchlight 2 mod folder. If you're unsure the exact folder location, use the "Open mods folder" button on the official Mod Launcher tool. If needed, check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5KeocjLUiA) for step-by-step instructions.

## On balance

Balance has been tested this way, on Normal difficulty:

1. Run the first area of the game multiple times
2. Don't use consumables and ignore containers
3. Pick all monster drops
4. Make a straighforward bee-line to the end of the area
5. Sell all loot and gear once you reach the first town
6. Make note of the final amount of gold owned, deducing the value of the given starting items (~400 gold)
7. Take a median from all runs

The results:
* Vanilla: ~300 gold
* No Loot Drops: ~300 gold

For a number of reasons this isn't as "perfect" as the numbers initially suggest but further playtesting hasn't shown any major issues in balance. Opinions and feedback on this matter from more experienced players are very welcome!

## What is changed?

1. All `TREASURE_MONSTERLOOT_*` Spawn Classes that don't targer a specific unit or specific unit types have been modified to roll directly on the `GOLD_PIECE` table (or their original values for `NONE`) instead of the various other tables (such as `TREASURE`, `CHAMPION_TREASURE`, etc). This is a very simple approach that does not take a couple technicalities under consideration but it seems to be balanced enough while also being maximally compatible with other mods.

## Possible future changes

1. ~~Consider boosting the amount of gold dropped, using the minimum- and maximum-rolls fields, to make up for having to depend more on expensive vendor purchases~~ (further testing shows this probably isn't necessary).
