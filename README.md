# No Loot Drops for Torchlight II

This Torchlight 2 mod makes enemies drop only gold, allowing you to focus on clearing while adventuring - leaving the item management and theorycrafting for when you're safely back in town. And why would a dog ever drop a sword or ring...?

Chests have had their item drop rates reduced ten-fold but their quality doubled. You won't find empty chests everywhere though - a shiny pile of gold should drop roughly every time you'd have found a less rare item in the vanilla game!

With random loot still being generated by chests and other sources, this approach allows for the usual excitement of coming across epic gear (and the challenge of making the most out of that), while also promoting more intentional agency and strategy in your theorycrafting because you have to deliberately choose when and how to spend your gold rather than just picking incremental upgrades off of the ground.

## How to install

**Steam workshop version:** if you own the game on Steam, simply open the [Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2482564330) and hit the "subscribe" button. Next time you launch the game, enable the mod as normal through the official Mod Launcher.

**Manual install:** Download the latest version of the mod file from [the GitHub release page](https://github.com/tukkek/torchlight2-NoLootDrops/releases) and place it on your Torchlight 2 mod folder. If you're unsure the exact folder location, use the "Open mods folder" button on the official Mod Launcher tool.

## Balance report

Each line represents a thousand rolls on the respective Spawn Class. Note that where applicable, values are approximated to the most significant digit. Also, since this has to be done manually, these are more of a "bird's-eye view" accounting than precise values.

hp = health potion

## What is changed?

1. Generic `CHEST_TREASURE_*` tables:
    1. Merge the to-be-modified weights into a `NONE` entry, creating one where necessary.
    2. Weapon, armor and trinket entries were reduced to 10% their weights, with 500% Magic Find. Activate "No uniques".
    3. For each modified line, make a copy that rolls in the respective `TREASRE_A_UNIQUE_*` instead with 50% the modified weight.
2. Generic `TREASURE_CHEST_*` tables: consumable entries converted to `GOLD_PIECES`, with their `MAX` values doubled, where applicable.
3. Generic `TREASURE_MONSTERLOOT_*` tables: all entries converted to `GOLD_PIECES`, with their `MAX` values doubled, where applicable (including previous `GOLD_PIECES`  entries).
